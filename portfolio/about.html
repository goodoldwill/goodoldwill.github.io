	<h1>About meh</h1>

	<p>  I generate the feedback and insight teams need to build a clear picture of their users and deliver solutions that they need.

	<br>

Iâ€™m experienced in a variety of user testing methodologies using quantitative and qualitative to gather evidence to test against hypothesis, reckons and ideas.

<br>

Involved at all phases of the project I work closely and collaboratively with users, designers, developers product owners & senior management. In the early stages of discovery I assist in developing a clear understanding and empathy for end users, making sense of existing research and commissioning or conducting additional research.

<br>

Through the later phases I work closely with the design team to provide guidance based on their understanding of end user needs and behaviour, and working with the team to design methods to answer outstanding questions about the users and the design of the service being created.
